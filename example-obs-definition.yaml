# This file is an example file for "defining" an observation. It should be included
# inside an observation directory, and provides meta-information about which files
# are useful vs. not, and how to "complete" the observation if not all files are
# available.

# An observation definition in any included/preferred directory will be used to
# complement this one.

# A root observation directory from which all paths in this definition are relative
# (unless specified as absolute).
root_obs_dir: '../..'

# Use this key only if this entire observation is to be considered invalid for some
# reason. If so, specify the reason. Note that it can also help to add ".invalid" to
# the end of the overall observation folder.
entirely_invalid: 'reason'

include:
  # List of directories to include to supplement this observation.
  # These are only used if they are not available in this observation.
  # Specifying a top-level directory means everything under it will be included.

prefer:
  # Similar to "include", but uses the preferred directory wherever it contains files
  # whether or not this observation contains those files.

invalid:
  # A list of specific files (glob-compatible) in this observation that should be always
  # ignored. Note that these *should* have filename extensions of ".invalid" or ".old"
  # in which case including them here is unnecessary. This just provides an alternate
  # path of achieving the same thing.

measurements:
  # Use this section to define any parameters of the run(s).
  resistance_m: 50.0
  resistance_f: 50.0

defaults:
  # Use this section to give default run numbers / repeat numbers to use
  # Note that you don't *need* this section: by default in the program, the last run and repeat
  # will be used for each load. It is restricted to use the same repeat for all standards
  # within a load.
  run:
    ambient: 1
    hot_load: 2
    short: 1
    open: 2
