Using ``edges-analysis``
========================

You can use ``edges-analysis`` via the Python library, or the command-line.
While the Python library has more features (eg. plotting), the command-line is
recommended for performing the actual processing of the data for publications.
This is because it is better able to keep track of the history and intermediate steps,
making the results more reproducible.
