Tutorials
=========

After reading the `Quickstart Guide <quickstart>`_, a good place to get a feel for how
``edges-analysis`` works is by following some tutorials. Since ``edges-analysis`` is a
large library with several different/standalone tools, these tutorials are not designed
to be read in a linear fashion. Instead, they are designed to be a reference for when
you need to do something specific.

   demos/comparison_of_beamfactor_to_alan
   demos/beam_factor_sensitivities

If you've covered the tutorials and still have questions about "how to do stuff" with
``edges``, consult the FAQs:
