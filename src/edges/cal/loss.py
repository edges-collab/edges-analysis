    This function operates in the context of a cable (or balun, etc.) that is attached
    to an input (generally the antenna, or a calibration load). It computes the loss
    due to the cable, given the scattering matrix of the cable itself, and the S11
    of the input antenna/load.

    The equations here are described in MIT EDGES Memo #132:
    https://www.haystack.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/memo_EDGES_132.pdf.
    We use two of the equations, to be specific: the equation for Gamma_a (the antenna
    reflection coefficient at the input of the cable), and the equation for the loss,
    L.

    SGM: as far as I can tell, this function *doesn't* assume that S12 == S21, though
    actual calls to this function generally throughout our calibration do make this
    assumption.
