    """Determine noise-wave calibration coefficients iteratively.

    This is the algorithm used for Bowman+2018 to determine the calibration
    coefficients from lab-based observations of the receiver.

    Parameters
    ----------
    cterms
        The number of parameters in the models for the overall scale and offset
        temperatures.
    wterms
        The number of parameters in the models for the noise-wave temperatures.
    apply_loss_to_true_temp
        Whether to apply losses to the true "known" temperature, or inversely
        to the spectra under calibration. Bowman+2018 sets this to False.
    smooth_scale_offset_within_loop
        Whether to smooth the scale and offset temperatures within the iterative
        loop, or only after the loop has converged.
    cable_delay_sweep
        The delays to search to determine the delay of the long cable (used for
        two of the calibration loads).
    ncal_iter
        The number of iterations to use in the main loop.
    fit_method
        The alogirhtm to use in the linear fit.
    scale_offset_poly_spacing
        Sets the indices in the scale/offset polynomial models. Bowman+2018 uses 0.5.
    t_load_guess
        An initial guess for t_load. In principle, this parameter is completely
        ineffective, but it's possible that a good choice makes the iterations more
        stable.
    t_load_ns_guess
        The same as t_load_guess but for the load+noise-source temperature.

    Returns
    -------
    calibrator
        A calibrator object with all the coefficients.
