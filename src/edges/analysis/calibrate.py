    This always applies the beam correction to each time sample in the data. If you want
    to average the data *before* applying the beam correction, you must average the data
    before applying this function to it. The input beam factor object should cover the
    full range of LSTs included in the data itself.

    The beam factor object is defined at a set of LSTs, and by default, the correction
    applied to the data is the *average* beam factor in each LST-bin of the data.
    To use the beam factor *interpolated* to the LSTs of the data instead, set
    ``interpolate_to_lsts`` to True.

    There are two ways to define the average beam factor within an LST-bin: either
    by taking the mean of ratios (of beam-weighted foreground model to *reference*
    beam-weighted foreground model) or the ratio of means. Switch between these
    by using the ``integrate_before_ratio`` parameter.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data
        Data to be calibrated.
    beam
        Either a path to a file containing beam correction coefficients, or the
        BeamFactor object itself.
    freq_model
        The (linear) model to use when evaluating the beam factor at the data freqs.
    integrate_before_ratio
        Whether to integrate (over time) the beam-weighted sky temperature and the
        reference sky temperature individually before taking their ratio to get
        the beam factor.
    oversample_factor
        The number of LST samples to use when interpolating the beam factor to the
        LSTs of the data. For every data LST, ``oversample_factor`` LSTs will be
        interpolated to (regularly spaced between each data LST, regardless of whether
        the data LSTs are regular). This is only used if ``resample_beam_lsts`` is True.
    resample_beam_lsts
        Whether to resample LSTs before averaging (by ``oversample_factor``).
    lsts
        If given, resample to these LSTs exactly, instead of trying to use the
        LST ranges in the data with oversample_factor.
    cut_to_data_lsts
        If True, cut the LSTs at which the beam is sampled to lie within the
        LST ranges of the data in each LST bin. Only set this to False if you have
        a single LST bin in the data and you know precisely the LSTs at which you
        want to sample the beam.
