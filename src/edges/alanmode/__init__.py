"""A sub-package dedicated to implementing a similar interface to the legacy C-code.

This module is not the suggested way to use the edges package, but it can help with
identifying differences between this analysis code and the original (legacy) C code 
that was used to obtain e.g. the results of Bowman+2018.

The idea is that here all the parameter names and defaults are the same as in the C-code,
with functions available that replicate entire C-programs.
