# This file is an example file for "defining" an observation. It should be included
# inside an observation directory, and provides meta-information about which files
# are useful vs. not, and how to "complete" the observation if not all files are
# available.

# An observation definition in any included/preferred directory will be used to
# complement this one.

# A root observation directory from which all paths in this definition are relative
# (unless specified as absolute).
root_obs_dir: '../'

include:
  # List of directories to include to supplement this observation.
  # These are only used if they are not available in this observation.
  # Specifying a top-level directory means everything under it will be included.

defaults:
  # Use this section to give default run numbers / repeat numbers to use
  # Note that you don't *need* this section: by default in the program, the last run
  # will be used. Use this only if you know that the first run is better for some reason.
  resistance:
    run: 1        # Specifies which run to use (by default) for _all_ sources
    hot_load: 2   # Specifies which run to use for hot_load. Over-rides 'run' if provided.
  spectra:
    ambient: 1    # use the first run for ambient (by default). Note that the default for all
                  # other sources here will be the last available run. Also, spectra
                  # can contain multiple files per-run, which are just merged in the read.
  s11:
    repeat: 1     # Sets the default repeat number for all s11 files.
    run:    1     # Sets the default run number for all s11 files (within the repeat)
    SwitchingState:
      repeat: 2   # Default repeat for switching state
      run:    1   # Default run num for switching state files
      match:  2   # Default run num for match load within switching state.
