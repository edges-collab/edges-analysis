**Analysis and Calibration Code for the EDGES experiment**

``edges-analysis`` has methods for I/O, receiver calibration, averaging, filtering and
calibrating EDGES data. The primary goal of the code is to allow the analysis to be
fully reproducible, efficient, and clear.

Features
========

``edges-analysis`` includes the following features:

* Methods for reading/writiing EDGES-specific datasets/data products.
* A full set of methods for receiver calibration, applicable to *most*
  current global 21cm experiments (based on Dicke-switch calibration +
  the noise-wave formalism).
* Many algorithms/routines for flagging bad data, including RFI, outliers
  in time/frequency, poor auxiliary data etc.
* A full-featured interface for linear modelling and fitting.
* Algorithms for consistent averaging of data over nights/times/frequencies,
  either in specified bins or complete averaging of the dataset.
* Works with ``pygsdata`` objects for a consistent interface all the way through
  an analysis pipeline, including maintenance of metadata about the operations
  applied to particular data (and propagation of metadata like the number
  of averaged samples).
* Simulation algorithms, including beam models and sky models.

Documentation
=============

Installation
============

This package can be installed with ``pip``::

   pip install edges-analysis

If you want all the extras (for development etc), use the ``[dev]`` extra, like so::

  pip install edges-analysis[dev]


You can also install directly from github. Either cloning first::

    git clone https://github.com/edges-collab/edges-analysis
    cd edges-analysis
    pip install [-e] .

or directly::

    pip install git+git://github.com/edges-collab/edges-analysis.git
